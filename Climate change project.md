I tought it would be neat if we shared our projects here (and also Alice mentioned it too).
Didn't want to upload all files again to this repository, so for now here's the link to our projects repository:
- Climate change project: https://github.com/gsiraji/wins-topics-network
The goal of the project was to see if and how the network of keywords/topics from different papers associated with climate change (and NLP) change through time.
We employ different NLP techniques to find the keywords or topics from arXiv abstracts, and build networks for periods: 2007-2012, 2013-2018, 2019-2023.
